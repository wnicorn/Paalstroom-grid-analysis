# Paalstroom Grid Analysis Scripts

Instructions on how to use:
1. Open the creat_results_folders.py and follow the instructions
2. For each of the Gaia files, open the file and run the Final_macro.gmf (and don't touch Excel while the simulations are running)
3. Open the data_cleaning.py and follow the instructions
4. Open the Graphics.py and follow the instructions

Please not that performing the Gaia macros might take hours if several networks are analysed. 
Also the data_cleaning.py is not optimized for speed, and hence for large number of simulations, this scvript needs time to complete as well. 
After the data cleaning, the graphics script is fast.
